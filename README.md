### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MustakimShaikh01/Node-app-aws.git
   cd Node-app-aws
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**

   * Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   * Add your configurations (example):

     ```
     PORT=3000
     AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_key
     AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret
     AWS_REGION=ap-south-1
     ```

### Usage

**Start the server**

```bash
node server.js
```

The application should now be running on:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

**Example API Endpoints**

* `GET /` – Health check
* `POST /upload` – Upload a file to AWS S3 (if implemented)
* `GET /items` – Fetch items from a database or AWS service

---

### Deployment

* Can be deployed to AWS EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, or containers (Docker + ECS/EKS).
* Ensure `.env` values are set in the deployment environment.

---

### Scripts

* `npm start` – Runs `server.js`
* `npm run dev` – Runs with nodemon (if added)
* `npm test` – Runs tests (if any)
